# Operation: URL Phishing (REMLA Team 14)
Central repository that contains all information about running the URL Phishing application and operating the cluster.

Later, this repository will also contain information about provisioning and deployment (Vagrant, Ansible, Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.).
For now, this repository merely contains a `docker-compose` file, serving as the most simple way to deploy the application for a showcase.

## About

- Our `app` and `model-service` are released as two separate container images (can be deployed separately from each other)
- Our ML model is released as well (see `release.yml` in our `model-training` repository), which can be exchangeable

## High-level Architecture

- TODO: Introduce architecture
- TODO: Add links to repos

This project is powered by several components which have their dedicated repositories:
- `app`
- `lib-version`
- `model-service`
- `model-training`
